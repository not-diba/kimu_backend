# 🦾 Kimu Backend

This is the **original backend** for the Kimu Foods platform — built with **Go**, **GraphQL (schema-first)**, and **PostgreSQL**.

It powered the first version of the mobile app, providing core APIs for recipes, ingredients, and grocery orders.

> ⚠️ This version has since been succeeded by [`kimu-engine`](https://github.com/not-diba/kimu-engine), a TypeScript-based GraphQL API using Nexus and Prisma.
